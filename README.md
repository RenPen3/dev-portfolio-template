# Minimalistic Developer Portfolio Template - Instruction Guide

Thank you for downloading the Minimalistic Developer Portfolio Template! Follow the instructions below to set up and view your portfolio.

## Step 1: Download and Install an IDE
To edit and view your developer portfolio template, you'll need to use an Integrated Development Environment (IDE). I recommend using Visual Studio Code (VSCode). Here's how to get started:

### 1. Download VSCode:

* Go to the [Visual Studio Code website](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

* Click on the download button that corresponds to your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).

* Once the download is complete, follow the installation instructions provided.

### 2. Alternative IDEs:

If you prefer a different IDE, you can also use [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/) or [Atom](https://atom-editor.cc/).

## Step 2: Open the Template in Your IDE

1. Once you’ve installed VSCode, open it.

2. In VSCode, go to File > Open Folder and select the folder where you extracted the portfolio template files.

3. You should see a file named index.html in the file explorer on the left.

## Step 3: Install the Live Server Extension

To view your developer portfolio in the browser and see changes in real-time, you’ll need to install the Live Server extension.

1. Click on the Extensions icon on the sidebar (or press Ctrl+Shift+X).

2. In the search bar, type Live Server.

3. Click on Live Server from the list and then click the Install button.

## Step 4: Launch the Portfolio with Live Server

1. Right-click on the index.html file in the file explorer.

2. Select Open with Live Server.

3. A new browser window will open, displaying your portfolio template.

## Step 5: Customize Your Portfolio

You can now edit the '#0055fb'index.html, style.css, and script.js files in VSCode to customize your portfolio. As you make changes, they will automatically be reflected in the browser.
