# Minimalistic Developer Portfolio Template - Instruction Guide

Thank you for downloading the Minimalistic Developer Portfolio Template! Follow the instructions below to set up and view your portfolio.

## Step 1: Download and Install an IDE
To edit and view your developer portfolio template, you'll need to use an Integrated Development Environment (IDE). We recommend using Visual Studio Code (VSCode). Here's how to get started:

### 1. Download VSCode:

* Go to the Visual Studio Code website[https://code.visualstudio.com/].
* Click on the download button that corresponds to your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).
* Once the download is complete, follow the installation instructions provided.

### 2. Alternative IDEs:

If you prefer a different IDE, you can also use Sublime Text or Atom.
Step 2: Open the Template in Your IDE
Once you’ve installed VSCode, open it.
In VSCode, go to File > Open Folder and select the folder where you extracted the portfolio template files.
You should see a file named index.html in the file explorer on the left.
Step 3: Install the Live Server Extension
To view your developer portfolio in the browser and see changes in real-time, you’ll need to install the Live Server extension.

Click on the Extensions icon on the sidebar (or press Ctrl+Shift+X).
In the search bar, type Live Server.
Click on Live Server from the list and then click the Install button.
Step 4: Launch the Portfolio with Live Server
Right-click on the index.html file in the file explorer.
Select Open with Live Server.
A new browser window will open, displaying your portfolio template.
Step 5: Customize Your Portfolio
You can now edit the index.html, style.css, and script.js files in VSCode to customize your portfolio. As you make changes, they will automatically be reflected in the browser.
